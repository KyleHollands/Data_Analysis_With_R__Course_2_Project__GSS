# Data_Analysis_With_R__Course_2_Project__GSS
The purpose of this project is to analyze the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset from the 1970s to 2012 to become more familiar with various inferential methods. The project will consist of multiple analyses, including:

A Chi-Square Test of Independence to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between two categorical variables (at least one with more than two levels.)
An ANOVA + pairwise testing to determine which pair contains a statistically significant difference.
An inference of a mean using the normal distribution to estimate the population mean from a sample mean and standard deviation.
The results of these analyses will be used to gain a better understanding of the data and to develop hypotheses about the relationships between the variables.

Although not perfect, the goal of this project was to demonstrate a certain degree of proficiency in using these different methods. There is still quite a bit more to learn, but this project was a good starting point.
