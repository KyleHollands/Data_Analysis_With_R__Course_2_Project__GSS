# Data_Analysis_With_R__Course_2_Project__GSS
The purpose of this project is to analyze the General Social Survey dataset from the 1970's to 2012.
For the sake of becoming more familiar with various inferential methods, the project consists
of multiple analyses: Chi-Square Test of Independence, ANOVA + pairwise testing, and inference of a mean using the normal distribution.

Although not perfect, the goal was to demonstrate a certain degree of comfortability using these different methods, even though there is quite a bit more to learn.
